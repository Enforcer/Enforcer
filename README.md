## Hi there 👋

I'm [@Enforcer](https://github.com/Enforcer) (*Sebastian Buczyński*) 🙋‍♂️

I'm a software engineer and trainer/consultant from Poland. 🇵🇱

## My mission 🎯

Advocate for software engineering in Python world. 📣

Making software is hard. Even though we have wonderful language, we're not special. Many challenges we face are universal and affect software developers working with other technologies as well. 

- We should learn from this large community, not alienating ourselves. 👩🏽‍💻🧑🏻‍💻👨🏾‍💻
- We should take good parts from elsewhere and implement them in Python, yet adjusting it to language and its idioms. 🐍
- We should be relentless in improvement and advancement of both our skills and the language. ⭐️

## My work 🔭

I train Pythonstas in [Bottega IT Minds](https://bottega.com.pl/). I teach Pythonistas [clean code, the Clean Architecture, microservices, Kafka and testing](https://bottega.com.pl/trener-trener-sebastian-buczynski). 👨‍🏫

I wrote a book [Implementing the Clean Architecture](https://leanpub.com/implementing-the-clean-architecture), here's an [accompanying repository](https://github.com/Enforcer/implementing-the-clean-architecture). 📘

I am currently working on open source project [Python Event Sourcery](https://github.com/python-event-sourcery/python-event-sourcery) to make Event Sourcing accessible for every Pythonista. 🐍
